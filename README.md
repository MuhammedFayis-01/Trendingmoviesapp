# movie
An exciting project , i had the logic in mind when i first saw the requirement,so it went smooth,Firstly i used some couple of packages which includes cached_network_image,tmdb_api,google_fonts.
Started with ui since the item had to come from api server ,i had to give itemcount so i used listview.builder for main screen
i used the tapped index from listview.builder and passed on the constructor for next screeen
coming to the api part i used tmdb_api package which gave different options to have for eg: trending movies,most viewed etc i integrated it and called it in the initstate itself so that while opening the app itself user sees the data
